# Using MindsDB to forecast financial time series data

This is the repo for the article based on my article on building a financial time series forecasting model using MindsDB.

I used the MindsDB [cloud editor](https://cloud.mindsdb.com/login) to build the model. The data was gotten from Kaggle and the name is [S&P 500 stock data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/sandp500?select=all_stocks_5yr.csv).
